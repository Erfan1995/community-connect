# Community Builders Project

Running both server and client locally in development mode:\
\
Runs client on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)\
Runs server on [http://localhost:3200](http://localhost:3200)

```bash
yarn dev
```


\
\
Let's handle production later - so use the above for now
```bash
yarn start
```
